I have made 2 files
  1. A python script (Assignment3.py)
  2. A I-python Notebook (AI_Assignment_3_TSP_with_genetic_Algorithm.ipynb)

The .ipynb has test case generators (buildGraph()) and .py file has command line input ( makeGraph())


Use python3

python3 Assignment3.py <Enter>

	or

python3 Assignment2.py < <Input File>

Input Format


* Number Of Cities
* Name Of Each city ( Separated by New Line) eg. 
	. A
	. B
	. ...
* Distance of cities (New Line Separated)  from all other cities ( Space Separated ) eg.
	. 0 12 10 ...
	. 12 0 20 ...
	. ....


I have also made 4 plots
	1. Graph with weights ( undirected )
	2. Generation (X) V.S Average Fitness i.e 1/pathCost (Y)
	3. Generation (X) V.S Minimum Path Cost
	4. Minimum cost path ( Directed Path )

Naming convention is itself explanatory but I have also incorporated comments wherever it is needed
Also attached a recording of code explanation and execution
